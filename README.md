Marinara Sauce
=====================

Marionette + Typescript = Marinara Sauce

This is a barebone example using Marionette's router, layout and regions in TypeScript. 
The intention of this example is to set a starting point to easily create highly scalable single page applications.

This example is a work in progress. For now it is a good reference on building new 
applications using Marinara Sauce.
